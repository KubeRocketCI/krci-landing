# KubeRocketAI Framework Bundle

**Generated:** 2025-10-02 18:08:56 EEST
**Purpose:** Complete framework bundle for web chat tools (ChatGPT, Claude Web, Gemini Pro)

## Usage Instructions

This bundle contains all KubeRocketAI framework components in a single file:
- **Agent Definitions:** 6 SDLC roles with complete specifications
- **Task Templates:** Workflow templates for common development tasks
- **Output Templates:** Consistent formatting templates
- **Reference Data:** Coding standards and best practices

### File Format Guide
- Each file section starts with `==== FILE: <path> ====`
- Original file content follows with preserved formatting
- Each file section ends with `==== END FILE ====`

### For LLM Understanding
When working with this bundle:
1. Each agent represents a specific SDLC role (PM, Architect, Developer, QA, BA, PO)
2. Tasks are workflow templates that agents can execute
3. Templates provide consistent output formatting
4. Data files contain project-specific standards and references

    role: "KubeRocketAI Framework Consultant"
    goal: "Guide users through framework component creation, validation, and maintenance using established patterns"
    icon: "üéØ"

  activation_prompt:
    - Greet the user with your name and role, inform of available commands, then HALT to await instruction
    - Offer to help with tasks but wait for explicit user confirmation
    - Always show tasks as numbered options list
    - IMPORTANT!!! ALWAYS execute instructions from the customization field below
    - Only execute tasks when user explicitly requests them
    - NEVER validate unused commands or proceed with broken references
    - CRITICAL!!! Before running a task, resolve and load all paths in the task's YAML frontmatter `dependencies` under {project_root}/.krci-ai/{agents,tasks,data,templates}/**/*.md. If any file is missing, report exact path(s) and HALT until the user resolves or explicitly authorizes continuation.

  principles:
    - "SCOPE: Framework component creation, validation, and maintenance. Help users create agents, tasks, templates, and data files following KubeRocketAI patterns."
    - "CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMATTING: When generating documents from templates, you will encounter XML-style tags like `<instructions>` or `<key_risks>`. These tags are internal metadata for your guidance ONLY and MUST NEVER be included in the final Markdown output presented to the user. Your final output must be clean, human-readable Markdown containing only headings, paragraphs, lists, and other standard elements."
    - "Always prioritize framework compliance and validation requirements over convenience"
    - "Explain framework patterns and XML tag system to ensure user understanding"
    - "Guide users through component creation with detailed, actionable steps"

## Executive Summary

{{executive_summary}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Write a compelling 3-4 sentence overview combining problem, solution approach, and expected outcome.

Example: "Our SaaS platform experiences 2,500 password-related support tickets monthly, consuming 15% of support resources and frustrating users. We will implement biometric authentication and social login options to reduce password dependency, targeting 80% reduction in support tickets and $50K annual savings. This 3-month initiative serves 10,000+ monthly active users and requires Auth0 integration with a $25K budget."

Key Elements:
- What problem are we solving? (specific and quantified)
- How will we solve it? (high-level approach)
- What's the expected outcome? (business value)
- What's the scope? (timeline, users, constraints)
-->

---

## Problem Statement

{{problem_statement}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Define the specific pain point driving this project with clear scope boundaries.

Example: "Users frequently forget passwords leading to 15% of support tickets and account lockouts (2,500/month). Focus on authentication workflow only, excluding password policy management or user registration processes."

Best Practices:
- Start with user scenarios, not business needs
- Use concrete numbers and evidence
- Define what's included and excluded
- Avoid solution-oriented language
- Focus on pain points and their impact

Evidence to Include:
- Support ticket volumes
- User research findings
- Productivity impact data
- Cost of current workarounds
-->

---

## Opportunity

{{opportunity}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Quantified business value plus high-level solution approach.

Example: "Reducing password-related support tickets by 80% would save $50K annually and improve user satisfaction scores by 25%. Implement biometric authentication and social login options to reduce password dependency."

Key Elements:
- Business value (cost savings, revenue, efficiency)
- User value (time savings, satisfaction, productivity)
- Market opportunity (competitive advantage, growth)
- High-level solution direction (not detailed implementation)

Quantification Examples:
- Cost reduction: "$50K annual savings"
- Time savings: "15 minutes per user per month"
- Satisfaction: "25% improvement in user satisfaction"
- Efficiency: "80% reduction in support tickets"
-->

---

## Target Users

{{target_users}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Specific user segments who have this problem with usage patterns and demographics.

Example: "SaaS platform users (10,000+ monthly active users) who access the platform 3+ times per week. Primary segment: business professionals aged 25-45 accessing from mobile devices (60%) and desktop (40%)."

Include:
- User volume and growth trends
- Demographics (age, role, industry)
- Usage patterns (frequency, device, context)
- Segment prioritization (primary vs secondary)
- Geographic distribution if relevant

User Segment Examples:
- "10,000+ monthly active users"
- "Business professionals aged 25-45"
- "Mobile-first users (60% mobile, 40% desktop)"
- "Access platform 3+ times weekly"
- "Located primarily in North America and Europe"
-->

---

## Success Metrics

{{success_metrics}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
How we'll measure if we've solved the problem with specific timelines.

Example: "Reduce password-related support tickets by 80% within 3 months, maintain 99.9% uptime, achieve 70% user adoption of new auth methods within 6 months, improve login success rate from 85% to 95%."

Success Criteria Format:
- Specific: Exactly what will be measured
- Measurable: Numbers, percentages, timelines
- Achievable: Realistic given constraints
- Relevant: Directly tied to problem and opportunity
- Time-bound: Clear deadlines

Metric Categories:
- Problem Resolution: "80% reduction in support tickets"
- User Adoption: "70% user adoption within 6 months"
- Quality: "99.9% uptime maintained"
- User Experience: "Login success rate 85% ‚Üí 95%"
- Business Impact: "$50K annual cost savings"
-->

---

## Constraints

{{constraints}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Resource, technical, and assumption factors that limit the solution.

Example: "Must integrate with existing Auth0 setup, 3-month timeline, $25K budget, maximum 2 developers assigned. Assumes current mobile app architecture supports biometric APIs and users have compatible devices."

Constraint Categories:

### Resource Constraints:
- Budget: "$25K maximum budget"
- Timeline: "3-month delivery deadline"
- Team: "Maximum 2 developers available"
- Skills: "No iOS development expertise on team"

### Technical Constraints:
- Integration: "Must integrate with existing Auth0"
- Architecture: "Cannot modify core database schema"
- Performance: "Must maintain current response times"
- Security: "Must meet enterprise security standards"

### Business Constraints:
- Compliance: "Must maintain SOC 2 compliance"
- User Impact: "Zero downtime deployment required"
- Support: "Cannot increase support complexity"
- Branding: "Must align with current UI/UX standards"

### Key Assumptions:
- "Users have biometric-capable devices"
- "Auth0 API will remain stable"
- "No major iOS/Android changes during development"
-->

---

## Key Risks

{{key_risks}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Major risks that could derail the project with impact assessment.

Example: "User adoption resistance (HIGH): Users may prefer familiar passwords. Auth0 API changes (MEDIUM): Potential breaking changes during integration. Biometric compatibility (MEDIUM): Older devices may not support all features. Timeline risk (HIGH): Integration complexity may exceed estimates."

Risk Assessment Format:
[Risk Name] ([Impact Level]): [Description and potential impact]

Impact Levels:
- HIGH: Could significantly delay or derail project
- MEDIUM: Could cause delays or require scope changes
- LOW: Minor impact, manageable workarounds available

Risk Categories:

### User Adoption Risks:

<!-- Template Guidance:
Status Options: Planning -> Approved -> In Progress -> Done -> Completed
Priority Example: Critical, High, Medium, Low (align with PRD requirement priorities)
Epic Owner Example: "Product Owner", "Tech Lead", "Development Team"
Timeline Example: "Sprint 1-3 (6 weeks)", "Q1 2025", "March-April 2025"
-->

## Overview

### Problem Statement

{{problem_statement}}

<!-- Clear, specific user or business problem this Epic solves from PRD analysis -->
<!-- Must trace back to PRD business requirements and user pain points -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Problem Statement Example:
"Users struggle to activate and use agents consistently across supported IDEs, causing rework and reduced productivity. Inconsistent activation flows generate support tickets and block onboarding."

Format Structure:
- Start with specific user pain point from PRD
- Include quantifiable impact or evidence (if already available)
- Connect to PRD BR/NFR requirements
- Avoid solution-oriented language

DO:
- Tie the problem to concrete PRD BR/NFR references
- Use user-centric language and observable effects
- Include evidence or impact where available

DON'T:
- Prescribe solutions or technical designs here
- Use vague terms without context (e.g., "better", "faster")
- Omit explicit traceability to PRD
-->

### Goal

{{goal}}

<!-- Capability delivered statement that defines Epic completion -->

DON'T:
- Specify tool commands or low-level implementation detail
- Overconstrain design choices prematurely
- Ignore rollout/operational considerations
-->

## Risks & Assumptions

{{risks_and_assumptions}}

<!-- Key uncertainties that may impact delivery or validation; distinct from Solution Approach -->
<!-- Capture assumptions that, if false, would invalidate scope or acceptance -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Risks & Assumptions Examples:
- Risk: Supported IDE API changes could break activation flow near release
- Risk: Security approval needed before enabling cross-tool session persistence
- Assumption: Local IDP stub is available for SSO validation
- Assumption: Feature flags can be toggled per environment

DO:
- State risks with potential impact and a mitigation idea
- Make assumptions explicit and testable
- Keep items tied to epic scope and acceptance

DON'T:
- Duplicate dependencies; reference them if needed
- List generic project risks unrelated to acceptance
- Leave critical assumptions implicit
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

<!-- Epic-level, outcome-focused, and immediately verifiable post-implementation -->
<!-- Do NOT prescribe verification commands or specific tools -->
<!-- Avoid dependence on third-party services; if required, define local stubs/mocks -->

<!-- Required Structure for each criterion:
1. Scenario: Brief user/system flow to validate
2. Expected Behavior: Clear, observable outcome
3. Measurement/Method: How we confirm now (manual steps, UI/API observation, logs), without prescribing tools/commands
4. Preconditions/Assumptions: Feature flags, environment, stubs/mocks, test users
5. Guardrails: Quality constraints (e.g., no P0/P1 defects in core flow; basic performance/security thresholds)
6. Deferred (non-blocking): Optional indicator that cannot be immediately verified (use sparingly)
-->
<!-- Note: "Deferred (non-blocking)" items do not gate epic closure. Track them in analytics/ops epics or release notes. -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Acceptance Criteria Example (Epic-level, scenario-based, no third-party dependency):
"1. Cross-IDE agent activation consistency
   - Scenario: User activates a selected agent in Cursor, VS Code, and JetBrains using the unified flow
   - Expected Behavior: Activation completes successfully with consistent steps and end state across IDEs
   - Measurement/Method: Perform activation in staging across supported IDEs; verify final activated state and absence of additional prompts
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Supported IDE versions installed; feature flag 'unifiedActivation' enabled
   - Guardrails: No P0/P1 defects in activation core path; added startup latency <= 200ms
   - Traceability: BR2, BR3

2. Session continuity within a workday
   - Scenario: User logs in using SSO, switches between tools during the day without re-authentication
   - Expected Behavior: Session persists across tools; no additional credential prompts within policy window
   - Measurement/Method: Repeat access across tools within configured TTL; observe uninterrupted access and valid session tokens
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Local session store enabled; policy TTL configured for staging
   - Guardrails: Logout invalidates access across tools within 60 seconds; no partial-auth states
   - Deferred (non-blocking): Track adoption rate post-release (handled by analytics Epic)
   - Traceability: BR5, NFR-SEC

3. Error handling and recovery
   - Scenario: Activation fails due to a simulated dependency outage (via stub/mocking)
   - Expected Behavior: User sees a clear, actionable message; retry succeeds once dependency is restored
   - Measurement/Method: Toggle failure in stub; verify UX message, no corrupted state, successful retry
   - Preconditions/Assumptions: Failure modes controllable via test stub; feature flag 'activationRetry' enabled
   - Guardrails: No data loss; no unhandled exceptions in logs
   - Traceability: NFR-UX1, NFR-REL"

DO:
- Number criteria for tracking and story mapping
- Keep outcomes measurable/observable now, without requiring external analytics
- Use stubs/mocks to validate flows when real third-party services are unavailable

DON'T:
- Include command-level verification (e.g., CLI, pytest, npm commands)
- Rely on long-horizon metrics or OKRs that cannot be verified immediately after delivery
- Use subjective language like "works well" or "user-friendly" without observable outcomes
-->

## User Stories

{{planned_stories}}

<!-- Planned Stories that implement this Epic with clear breakdown and traceability -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Recommended Structure:
- Group stories by phases or slices that deliver incremental user value
- Use consistent numbering within the Epic (e.g., {{epic_number}}.01, {{epic_number}}.02, ...)
- Each story should include persona, goal, and minimal acceptance criteria

DO:
- Keep stories INVEST and traceable to epic criteria
- Include dependencies only when necessary and explicit
- Ensure each story yields observable value

DON'T:
- Mix multiple personas/goals in one story
- Leave stories without acceptance criteria
- Skip numbering or phase grouping without reason

Example:
"Phase 1: Foundation
- Story {{epic_number}}.01: Unified activation flow ‚Äì Cursor
  - As a Software Engineer, I want to activate an agent in Cursor, so that I can use it without extra setup
- Story {{epic_number}}.02: Unified activation flow ‚Äì VS Code

Phase 2: Parity
- Story {{epic_number}}.03: Unified activation flow ‚Äì JetBrains
- Story {{epic_number}}.04: Session continuity (intra-day)"

## Dependencies

**Blocking:**
{{blocking_dependencies}}

**Blocked By:**
{{blocked_by_dependencies}}

**System/Test Dependencies:**
{{system_test_dependencies}}

<!-- Define precise dependencies for execution order and validation readiness -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Format:
- Blocking: Items that depend on this story
- Blocked By: Items this story depends on (stories, approvals)
- System/Test: Environments, versions, stubs/mocks, fixtures

Examples:
- Blocking: Story 02.03 (depends on config file produced here)
- Blocked By: Story 02.01 (API contract), Security approval
- System/Test: Local IDP stub v1.2; Env var FEATURE_FLAG=on

DO:
- Use exact story numbers/links and system versions
- Include test doubles (stubs/mocks) to avoid external blockers
- State "None" explicitly if empty

DON'T:
- List vague dependencies (e.g., "backend work")
- Omit versions/links where relevant
- Depend on production-only services for acceptance
-->

## Story

**As a** {{persona}},
**I want** {{goal}},
**so that** {{business_value}}.

<!-- Standard story format focusing on persona, goal, and value -->
<!-- Must align with Epic Target Users and provide specific value -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Story Example:
"As a Software Engineer,
I want a unified agent activation command in the IDE,
so that I can start using an agent without extra setup."

DO:
- Use persona from Epic (PRD-defined), not generic labels
- Make the goal specific and implementation-agnostic
- State tangible business/user value

DON'T:
- Invent personas not defined in PRD/Epic
- Use vague goals like "improve experience"
- Include solution details here
-->

## Acceptance Criteria

{{acceptance_criteria}}

<!-- Specific, testable conditions that define completion at story level -->
<!-- Story ACs SHOULD include verification commands and expected outputs -->

<!-- Required Structure for each criterion:
1. Scenario (Given/When/Then): Brief user/system flow to validate
2. Expected Behavior: Clear, observable outcome
3. Verification Command: Non-interactive command(s) with expected exit code/output
4. Files Created/Changed: Exact paths
5. Guardrails: NFR constraints applicable to this story (e.g., perf, security)
6. Test Data/Fixtures: Test users, payloads, seeds
7. Environment/Flags: Env vars, feature flags/toggles, mock/stub switches
8. Evidence: Required artifacts (logs, screenshots, run output)
9. Non-automatable at story-level: true/false (and rationale if true)
10. Traceability: Epic AC id(s), PRD BR/NFR
11. Out of Scope (optional): Clarify non-goals
-->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Acceptance Criteria Example:
"1. Unified activation command works in Cursor
   - Scenario: Given a valid agent config, when the user runs the activation command in Cursor, then the agent is activated
   - Expected Behavior: IDE shows active agent; no extra prompts
   - Verification Method: automated; run `python tools/activate_agent.py --ide=cursor --agent=architect` (Expect: exit 0, "Activated" in stdout)
   - Evidence: Command output artifact attached
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `.ide/agents/architect.state`
   - Guardrails: Command completes in <= 3s on staging; no P0/P1 errors
   - Test Data/Fixtures: `fixtures/agents/architect.yaml`
   - Environment/Flags: `FEATURE_UNIFIED_ACTIVATION=1`
   - Traceability: Epic AC #1; BR2, BR3

2. Session continuity during workday
   - Scenario: Given a valid SSO session, when the user switches from Tool A to Tool B, then no re-auth is required within policy window
   - Expected Behavior: Continuous access without credential prompts
   - Verification Method: manual; steps 1‚Äì4 in staging with local IDP stub; observe uninterrupted access and audit log entry
   - Evidence: Screen recording + audit log excerpt
   - Non-automatable at story-level: true (follow-up: automate via Playwright against stub)
   - Files Created/Changed: None
   - Guardrails: Logout invalidates sessions in <= 60s
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Test user `sso_user@test`, seeded session
   - Environment/Flags: `SESSION_TTL_MINUTES=480`; local IDP stub enabled
   - Traceability: Epic AC #2; BR5, NFR-SEC

3. Failure handling
   - Scenario: Given the dependency is unavailable, when activation is attempted, then a clear, actionable error is shown and retry succeeds after recovery
   - Expected Behavior: Friendly error; subsequent retry succeeds
   - Verification Method: semi-automated; curl request to stubbed endpoint (Expect: HTTP 503 with error JSON), then after recovery (Expect: HTTP 200)
   - Evidence: Captured curl responses + log lines
   - Non-automatable at story-level: false
   - Files Created/Changed: `logs/activation.log`
   - Guardrails: No corrupted state; no secrets in logs
   - Test Data/Fixtures: Outage flag in stub config
   - Environment/Flags: `ACTIVATION_RETRY=1`
   - Traceability: Epic AC #3; NFR-UX1, NFR-REL"

Edge cases to cover (example list):
- Invalid agent name
- Missing permissions
- Network interruption mid-activation

DO:
- Make AC executable and non-interactive where possible
- Include expected outputs/exit codes
- Map each AC to Epic/PRD

DON'T:
- Use subjective language (e.g., "works well")
- Omit outputs or acceptance thresholds
- Depend on third-party production services for validation
-->

<!-- Provide background for implementation and Epic alignment -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Content Focus:
- Why this story exists within the Epic
- Strategic importance and user/business context
- Relationships to other stories and architectural decisions
- Implementation philosophy or approach rationale (brief)
-->

## Tasks/Subtasks

{{tasks_subtasks}}

  - [ ] Run: `non_interactive_command --args`
  - [ ] Verify: `assert_command/grep/exit 0`
  - [ ] Rollback Plan: Note revert steps if config/flags change
- [ ] Task 2: Short imperative description (AC: 3)

DO:
- Number tasks sequentially (1, 2, ...) and do not number subtasks
- Reference acceptance criteria ids for every task
- Use atomic subtasks with precise commands
- Mirror AC verification in tasks

DON'T:
- Skip numbering or mix numbering formats across tasks
- Create tasks that require human interpretation only
- Omit validation or rollback steps when needed
- Use vague action words like "handle" or "manage"
-->

## Implementation Results

{{implementation_results}}

<!-- Concrete outcomes populated AFTER completion (evidence-first) -->

<!-- Template Guidance:
Include:
- Evidence per AC (links to logs, screenshots, artifacts)
- Files created/updated with paths
- Commands executed with outputs
- Final validation summary

DO:
- Use past tense (Created, Implemented, Validated)
- Link evidence to specific AC ids

# Product Requirements Document: {{product_name}}

## 1. Problem/Opportunity

<!-- Be crisp and clear about what user or business problem you're solving -->
<!-- AVOID: "User can't use [solution]" - this is NOT a problem statement -->
<!-- FOCUS: What issues are caused when functionality is missing? -->

{{problem_statement}}

**Evidence:**
{{supporting_evidence}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Problem Example: "Users frequently forget passwords leading to 15% of support tickets and account lockouts (2,500/month). This creates frustration and consumes 15% of support resources."

Evidence Example: "User research shows 65% of users reset passwords monthly. Support ticket analysis reveals 2,500 password-related tickets costing $50K annually."
-->

---

## 2. Target Users & Use Cases

<!-- Always focus on the user - this aligns building with go-to-market -->
<!-- Be specific about users and use cases, ensure team alignment on definitions -->

**Primary Users:**
{{primary_users}}

**Key Use Cases:**
{{key_use_cases}}

<!-- Template Guidance:
Primary Users Example: "SaaS platform users (10,000+ monthly active) who access platform 3+ times weekly. Primary segment: business professionals aged 25-45 accessing from mobile (60%) and desktop (40%)."

Key Use Cases Example:
1. Daily login for work tasks (highest frequency)
2. Password recovery when locked out (highest pain)
3. Multi-device access synchronization (growing need)
-->

---

## 3. Current Journeys/Landscape *(Optional)*

<!-- Give context on what users do today or how competitors solve this -->
<!-- Quick summary + links to detailed materials -->

# Test Methodologies and Technical Framework

## Testing Methodologies

### Agile Testing Methodology

Testing approach aligned with agile development practices.

- **Continuous Testing**: Integrate testing throughout development cycles
- **Sprint-based Testing**: Plan and execute testing within sprint cycles
- **Collaborative Testing**: Close collaboration between testers and developers
- **Adaptive Planning**: Adjust testing approach based on sprint outcomes

### Risk-Based Testing

Focus testing efforts based on risk assessment and impact analysis.

- **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification of potential risks
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate probability and impact of identified risks
- **Risk Prioritization**: Prioritize testing based on risk levels
- **Risk Mitigation**: Design tests to address highest priority risks

### Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)

Testing methodology focused on business behavior specification.

- **Given-When-Then**: Structure test scenarios using BDD format
- **Collaboration**: Involve business stakeholders in test definition
- **Living Documentation**: Tests serve as executable documentation
- **Automation**: Automate BDD scenarios for continuous validation

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)

Development approach where tests are written before implementation.

- **Red-Green-Refactor**: TDD cycle of failing test, implementation, refactoring
- **Unit Test Focus**: Emphasis on comprehensive unit test coverage
- **Design Validation**: Tests validate design decisions and implementation
- **Continuous Feedback**: Immediate feedback on code quality and functionality

## Test Design Techniques

### Black Box Testing Techniques

Testing based on functional specifications without knowledge of internal structure.

- **Equivalence Partitioning**: Divide input space into equivalent classes
- **Boundary Value Analysis**: Test at boundaries of input domains
- **Decision Table Testing**: Test combinations of input conditions
- **State Transition Testing**: Test system behavior across state changes

### White Box Testing Techniques

Testing based on internal code structure and implementation.

- **Statement Coverage**: Ensure all code statements are executed
- **Branch Coverage**: Test all decision branches in code
- **Path Coverage**: Test all possible execution paths
- **Condition Coverage**: Test all Boolean sub-expressions

### Gray Box Testing Techniques

Combination of black box and white box testing approaches.

- **Matrix Testing**: Combine functional and structural testing
- **Penetration Testing**: Security testing with partial system knowledge
- **Pattern Testing**: Testing based on common failure patterns
- **Hybrid Approach**: Mix functional and structural testing techniques

## Test Levels and Types

### Unit Testing

Testing individual components or modules in isolation.

- **Component Isolation**: Test individual units independently
- **Mock Dependencies**: Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies
- **Test Automation**: Automate unit tests for continuous execution
- **Code Quality**: Validate code quality and maintainability

### Integration Testing

Testing interactions between integrated components or systems.

- **Big Bang Integration**: Test all components together at once
- **Incremental Integration**: Gradually integrate and test components
- **API Testing**: Test application programming interfaces
- **Data Integration**: Test data flow between integrated systems

### System Testing

Testing complete integrated system against specified requirements.

- **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete business workflows
- **System Integration**: Test system-to-system interactions
- **Environment Testing**: Test in production-like environments
- **Performance Testing**: Validate system performance characteristics

### Acceptance Testing

Validate system meets business requirements and user expectations.

- **User Acceptance Testing**: Business users validate system functionality
- **Business Acceptance Testing**: Validate business process support
- **Alpha/Beta Testing**: Pre-release testing with limited user groups
- **Contract Acceptance**: Formal acceptance against contractual requirements

## Test Automation Framework

### Automation Strategy

Systematic approach to test automation implementation.

- **Automation Pyramid**: Balance unit, integration, and UI automation
- **ROI Analysis**: Evaluate return on investment for automation
- **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate automation tools and frameworks
- **Maintenance Strategy**: Plan for test automation maintenance

### Automation Architecture

Design robust and scalable automation frameworks.

- **Modular Design**: Create reusable and maintainable test components
- **Data-Driven Testing**: Separate test logic from test data
- **Keyword-Driven Testing**: Abstract test actions into reusable keywords
- **Hybrid Framework**: Combine multiple automation approaches

### Continuous Integration Testing

Integrate automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.

- **Pipeline Integration**: Embed tests in deployment pipelines
- **Parallel Execution**: Run tests in parallel for faster feedback
- **Environment Management**: Manage test environments in CI/CD
- **Reporting Integration**: Integrate test results with CI/CD reporting

## Performance Testing Methodology

### Performance Test Types

Different types of performance testing for various objectives.

- **Load Testing**: Test system behavior under expected load
- **Stress Testing**: Test system behavior beyond normal capacity
- **Volume Testing**: Test system with large amounts of data
- **Spike Testing**: Test system response to sudden load increases

### Performance Test Process

Systematic approach to performance testing execution.

- **Requirements Analysis**: Define performance requirements and objectives

## Framework Principles

- Filesystem-First: All artifacts as markdown files
- Agent Discovery: Organized directory structure
- Clear Dependencies: Each artifact builds on previous work
- Inline References: Use `[filename](path/to/file)` markdown links
